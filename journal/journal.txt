    - When installing the pk2cmd, I had to install libusb-dev. Most people
      suggest that when using the libusb in C++, they suggest installing
      libsub-1.0.0, but I think libusb-dev was enough to "make" pk2cmd from the
      source.
    - The "sudo apt-get install sdcc" installed outdated sdcc which did not
      have the 18f6887.h header. Need to build from downloading the latest
      binary.
    - However, this binary is 32-bit, so I need to install some library so that
      Ubuntu 64bit can run 32-bit binary.
    - But after installing libraries for fixing 32-bit issue, there was
      `GLIBCXX_3.4.19' not found error. This issue was fixed by installing
      libstdc++6 from a non-default location: "ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test".

    - Learning how to use Pickit2. Make sure the wire connection from Pickit2
      to the development board is correct. There are white triangles (arrow) on
      both the Pickit2 and the board, so the wiring should match them.
    - Successfully programmed the chip, but I don't see the LED blinking.
      Either external power must be provided to the board, or I'm using wrong
      port to blink the light. Currently the port C is used in the blink.c.

    - Trying to turn on the LED light on the 44-pin demo board. Unsuccessful.

    - Maybe it is some kind of configuration problem.... Still figuring it out.
    - The path to the PIC header file is at:
      "/usr/local/share/sdcc/non-free/include/pic14/pic16f887.h"
