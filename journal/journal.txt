    - When installing the pk2cmd, I had to install libusb-dev. Most people
      suggest that when using the libusb in C++, they suggest installing
      libsub-1.0.0, but I think libusb-dev was enough to "make" pk2cmd from the
      source.
    - The "sudo apt-get install sdcc" installed outdated sdcc which did not
      have the 18f6887.h header. Need to build from downloading the latest
      binary.
    - However, this binary is 32-bit, so I need to install some library so that
      Ubuntu 64bit can run 32-bit binary.
    - But after installing libraries for fixing 32-bit issue, there was
      `GLIBCXX_3.4.19' not found error. This issue was fixed by installing
      libstdc++6 from a non-default location: "ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test".

    - Learning how to use Pickit2. Make sure the wire connection from Pickit2
      to the development board is correct. There are white triangles (arrow) on
      both the Pickit2 and the board, so the wiring should match them.
    - Successfully programmed the chip, but I don't see the LED blinking.
      Either external power must be provided to the board, or I'm using wrong
      port to blink the light. Currently the port C is used in the blink.c.

    - Trying to turn on the LED light on the 44-pin demo board. Unsuccessful.

    - Maybe it is some kind of configuration problem.... Still figuring it out.
    - The path to the PIC header file is at:
      "/usr/local/share/sdcc/non-free/include/pic14/pic16f887.h"

    - My Pickit2 is not powering the MCU (The "target" LED on Pickit2 is not
      lit.
    - Maybe I should try to program in Windows first.

    - MPLAB X is used to successfully blink LEDs on the 44-pin target board.
        1. Right click the "blink" project
        2. Click Properties
        3. Check Pickit 2 for the hardware tool
        4. Check xc8 compiler (install it if not found by MPLAB X)
        5. Choose correct PIC cihp (PIC16F887 for now)
        6. Then the source code should compile.
    - Sometimes, you have to program second time in order to get the code run
      in the actual hardware..

    - Installed MPLAB X on Ubuntu
2015.11.23 Monday
    - No success. Trying a combination of configuration bits.
2015.11.27 Friday 
    - Success with MPLAB X for blinking the LEDs. Correct configuration is needed
2015.11.28 Saturday
    - Failed to blink LEDs using SDCC
2015.12.3 Thursday
    - The potentiometer should NOT be turned all the way in the clock-wise
      direction. Somehow it draws power so that LED does not lit up even with
      using MPLAB X.
    - Was able to power the target using pk2cmd.
